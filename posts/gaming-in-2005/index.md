# Gaming in 2005
An overview of how gaming was twenty years ago

Twenty years ago, I was a gamer. Today, I still am. Gaming has always been one of the strongest influences in my life, shaping how I think, learn, and even approach my work. Every stage of my life is somehow linked to a specific game, a soundtrack, or a glowing screen that kept me company during long nights.

Despite my father’s disbelief in gaming and his fear that GTA San Andreas would turn me into a troublemaker, games taught me much more than they ever harmed me. Through them, I learned logic, problem solving, teamwork, and creativity. Most importantly, I learned how to focus on something I truly loved.

## Before games

Before discovering the world of gaming, I was one of those quiet nerds you’d find in every school. I read a lot, spent most of my breaks in the library, loved the science lab, and played chess instead of football. Music was another part of my routine, and I proudly played in the local marching band. Still, my contact with computers was very limited. My father bought our first computer when I was eleven, but I only used it for typing or listening to music.

Everything changed when I was thirteen. My father bought a used computer from someone, and to my surprise, it was filled with games. Not just a few. It was an entire hidden universe waiting for me. Among them were titles like Total Annihilation, Age of Empires II, StarCraft, and Need for Speed: Underground. Each one opened a door I didn’t know existed.

## An amazing discovery

One day, a friend came over and immediately recognized the icons scattered on my desktop. “Oh my God, you have Total Annihilation?” he said. I had no idea what that meant, but the way his eyes lit up told me it was something big. He opened the game and started building bases, mining resources, and commanding armies of robots. Within minutes, I was fascinated. It wasn’t just fun. It felt like an entirely new way to think.

From that point on, I spent months playing it every day. The rhythm of the game combined with the music I listened to, bands like Apocalyptica and Angra, made everything feel epic. Later, that same friend introduced me to two other computer enthusiasts, one of whom turned out to be the computer’s previous owner. That was the beginning of a friendship that would last for years.

## A true friendship and shared passion

We spent countless afternoons playing together. We played games like Monster Hunter and Shadow of Colossus on PS2. On PC we played Fly for Fun (MMO), Warcraft III, DOTA All Stars, Counter-Strike, and others.

We exchanged CDs, created custom maps, and tried mods we barely understood. At each house, there was a different game and a different setup, but the energy was always the same. Laughter, competition, and hours that passed in what felt like minutes.

At home, I explored single-player games such as The Sims 2, Spore, Need for Speed: Most Wanted, and Banished. Each game offered its own kind of escape, teaching me how to appreciate art, music, and storytelling in different forms.

These moments didn’t just entertain me. They made me curious about how things worked behind the scenes.

## Learning more about computers

My curiosity about computers grew quickly. I learned to install games, troubleshoot problems, and reorganize files when something went wrong. I had no idea, but those small steps were my introduction to systems and logic. I started to understand that technology was not just a tool for entertainment but something I could master.

By 2008, I was living in a small countryside town where internet connections were rare. The government created a program called “Telecentro” that provided public access to computers and the internet. When I was sixteen, I applied to be one of the trainees responsible for maintaining those machines. They used Linux, and that experience expanded my knowledge enormously. It was the first time I heard of Python, and although I didn’t use it much back then, the seed was planted.

Every day, I downloaded books and tutorials, stored them on my MP3 player, and read them at home where I had no internet. I was fascinated by HTML, website layouts, and how lines of text could turn into colors and images on a screen. My gaming passion slowly evolved into curiosity about how software was built.

## Early adulthood and the age of online play

When I turned eighteen, I moved out of my hometown. For a while, I didn’t have a computer, so my gaming was limited to weekends at my mother’s house. Later, when I finally bought a new computer in monthly instalments, everything changed. It felt like freedom. I reconnected with friends through MSN, played online matches, and discovered the joy of LAN parties. We organized late-night gaming sessions, DOTA tournaments, and weekend marathons. It was pure fun and connection.

At that time, my favorite titles were DOTA All Stars, DOTA 2, and Warcraft III. I also enjoyed experimenting with games like Call of Duty, SimCity 4, and RollerCoaster Tycoon. The mix of competition, creation, and simulation perfectly matched my personality.

## Steam and the modern era

When I created my Steam account, I could only play free games like DOTA 2 and Counter-Strike. Over time, my library grew as I bought more titles. When I later moved to a coastal city and got a stable job, I finally had the means to explore gaming the way I always wanted. My Steam library became my personal museum, filled with hundreds of games waiting to be played.

I discovered Factorio around that time, and it changed everything. Building automated factories and optimizing production lines fit my mind like LEGO for adults. I also spent time on sandbox games like Cities: Skylines, Satisfactory, and RimWorld, each one testing a different side of my creativity and logic.

## Gaming today

Today, I still play, although my habits have changed. I prefer offline or PvE games that let me pause and return at my own pace. Good examples are my all time favorite Factorio, and lately Escape from Duckov. Being a parent leaves less time for long online sessions, but gaming still gives me the same sense of calm and inspiration as before.

The gaming industry, however, has transformed dramatically. Games like Fortnite, Roblox, and Minecraft have created universal ecosystems where the platform doesn’t matter.

Players no longer identify as PC or console gamers. They identify by the game they play. My son is a perfect example. He plays only Roblox, and within it, he explores countless worlds created by others. For him, Roblox isn’t a game. It’s the entire universe of gaming.

## Looking back

When I look back, I realize that gaming wasn’t just a phase or a distraction. It was an education in disguise. It taught me how to think, collaborate, and stay curious. It helped me find my path in technology and still reminds me that curiosity and creativity are worth nurturing.

Gaming in 2005 was the spark that started it all. It was a time of discovery, friendship, and imagination. And even today, every time I open a new game, I can still feel the same excitement I felt twenty years ago.

See you in the next one. Stay safe, stay hydrated.
